This directory is for storing custom fonts used in the MOMNT application.

Currently using Google Fonts (Inter) for the main typography.
Custom fonts can be added here if needed for:
- Logo fonts
- Special headings
- Brand-specific typography

To use custom fonts, add @font-face declarations in the CSS files.
